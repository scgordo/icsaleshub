This is my first production-level web app. Submitted as my final project for COSW220 at Long Beach City College.

This application was written without using git for version control, and written without using a framework for PHP. As a result, it's a little ugly and messy. I plan on getting around to cleaning it up some day (but not today...).

The application was designed specifically for my software company which specializes in patient documentation for inpatient rehabilitation units. The app is used to track sales progress to the over 1300 inpatient rehab units across the country. Users are able to add, modify, or remove prospective facilities entirely through the application interface which makes the changes on the database. Deletions can only be done by administrators, and there is a different administrator UI for users that are designated as such.

All code was written by Scott Gordon, but I purposely made this repo public for any of my friends or other junior level developers to suggest modifications to make this application better. I doubt anyone will ever read this, but if you find yourself here, I'd love to hear your thoughts or input on how to improve this application.

It's not clean, it has sketchy security, it's written in vanilla PHP. It's clunky, the interface isn't great, and the css could use some serious help. However it's mine, it's my first production-level application, and it (mostly) works as intended. I'm incredibly proud, and hope this is my worst production application ever published.
